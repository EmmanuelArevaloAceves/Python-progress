# Python Progress

This repository is dedicated to documenting and sharing my development as a **Backend Python Developer**. It contains exercises, projects, and practice tasks focused on data structures, design patterns, automation, and general software development using Python.

## About Me

My name is **Emmanuel Arevalo**. I am currently studying **Computer Systems Engineering** with a strong focus on backend development using **Python**.

I work as a **Backend Developer**, developing projects that involve:

- Business logic design
- File and data management
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- SOLID principles and design patterns (such as Singleton and Factory)
- System integration

## Purpose of this Repository

The main goals of this repository are to:

- Showcase my learning process and development as a backend developer
- Document challenges and solutions in various programming scenarios
- Demonstrate clean code practices and real-world project structures
- Build a reusable and scalable codebase

## Folder Structure

- `Create_Document/`: A project that simulates a document creation and tracking system using **Factory Method** and **Singleton** design patterns.
- `week2/`: Practical exercises focused on programming logic, inventory management, and point-of-sale systems.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11+
- Git and GitHub
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton)
